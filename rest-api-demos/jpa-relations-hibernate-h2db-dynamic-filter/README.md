# JPA Mapping and Dynamic Filtering with H2DB using Hibernate

All possible **RDBMS** relationships have been explored in this project.
In order to prevent infinite recursion, **JsonFilter** annotation has been 
applied in the models and the fields of the models are recursive 
for a specific API filtered programmatically.

### Covered Relationships
- [x] One-to-One
- [x] One-to-Many
- [X] Many-to-One
- [x] Many-to-many
